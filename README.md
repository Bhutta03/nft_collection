# nft_collection
This smart contract is designed to manage an NFT collection. It allows the owner to create new NFTs (minting) and associate each NFT with their NEAR account ID. The UnorderedMap is used to keep track of the ownership of each NFT by storing the mapping of token IDs to owner account IDs. The contract also ensures that it's properly initialized and that only the owner can mint NFTs

We can also add more funcnalities into our smart contract
Metadata: You can associate metadata with each NFT, allowing you to store additional information about the tokens, such as their names, descriptions, and links to images or other content.

Transfer NFTs: Implement the ability to transfer NFTs between different NEAR accounts. This enables the buying and selling of NFTs within the NEAR ecosystem.

Burn NFTs: Add a functionality to allow the owner to burn (destroy) NFTs, removing them from the collection.

Access Control: Define roles and permissions within the contract to allow multiple users to interact with the collection, not just the owner. For example, you can have minting administrators who can mint NFTs.

NFT Market: Create an integrated marketplace where users can list their NFTs for sale and others can purchase them.

Royalties: Implement royalty fees for creators. This ensures that creators receive a portion of the sale price whenever an NFT is resold.

Minting Costs: Add minting costs or fees for creating NFTs. This can help prevent spamming of the contract.

Metadata Management: Implement the management of token metadata in an efficient and organized way, ensuring that metadata is retrievable for each NFT.

Events and Notifications: Emit events and notifications when minting, transferring, or selling NFTs. This allows external systems to listen for changes in the contract state.

Upgradeability: Consider implementing an upgrade mechanism that allows for the contract to be updated while preserving the existing state and NFT ownership.

Remember that implementing all these features can be a complex task, and it's important to thoroughly test and secure your smart contract to ensure it functions as intended and is safe for users. Additionally, you can leverage external libraries and standards in the NEAR ecosystem to make development more efficient and compatible with other NEAR-based projects and marketplaces.
